A study project for practicing fetching data and React Router.

### About this project

There are 2 pages: a home page and an article page. Also, there is handling 404 errors - not found page.

### Tools and technologies

The stack of the project is: react, react-router-dom, CSS Modules

I've used built-in React Hooks for managing a local state and creating custom hooks. For example, I've created useFetch to make work with data fetching easier.

I've used react-router-dom for the ability to move from page to page without reloading the browser in a single-page application.

CSS Modules is a very convenient way to have scoped styles and the ability not to repeat styles, which simplifies this project and the ability not to make mistakes.

### What I've learned

In the project I've learned what is react-router and how to use it, learned how module css works, created custom hooks.


### How to work with the project

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
